Presentation tips for developers

Recently I have had the chance to watch a fair amount of technical presentations as well as give a few of them myself. These experiences have led me to some conclusions regarding the skills of giving presentations (or lack thereof) and I wanted to share my observations.

I will not discuss the general rules of presenting. These can be found <here> or <here>. Instead, I will focus on aspects that are key to programming / technical presentations.

-- Keep the terminal up
- very often when several commands have already been executed, the terminal prompt ends up at the bottom of the screen
	- either you as the presenter block its view from the audience, or it simply is too low for people in the farther rows to see

-- Make the code big
- the code editor font should be big, or even VERY BIG
- it's best to turn your IDE into "presentation mode" (e.g. IntelliJ IDEA)

-- Let the code unfold
- do not present big blocks of code at once
- your audience will be overwhelmed
- they will read the code and not follow you, or they will not understand the code
- it is much better to show code in small increments 
	- either as consequent slides
	- or if you're presenting from an editor you can either write it on the go or use git tags / branches <paste link do git next / git prev>

-- Do not assume your audience knows what you're talking about
- sometimes people may not be familiar with the underlying concept and your whole talk will not be understood
- every concept's basics can be explained in a few short sentences
- this ensures your audience can follow you

-- Prefer live coding to already prepared code
- it's harder for you, but it's more effective and it allows the audience to follow you more easily 

-- Prepare and test
