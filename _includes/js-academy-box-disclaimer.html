    <div>This article is based on a series of great books by Kyle Simpson available for free 
        on <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS" target="_blank">Github</a>.</div>
    <div>I present the same concepts in a simplified manner using my own words with the occassional 
        addition of (un)funny comments.</div>
    <div>If you want to dive deeper I encourage you to read the original books.</div>
