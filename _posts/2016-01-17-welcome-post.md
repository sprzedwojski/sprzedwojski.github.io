Welcome to my blog.
I have set it up to share my thoughts about software development with the world.


If you visit me again in the future, you can expect posts about 
Java, Spring, JavaScript, Node.js and more concerning web development, 
clean code, RESTful Web APIs, setting up webservers etc.


I hope to see you again. Until next time!
