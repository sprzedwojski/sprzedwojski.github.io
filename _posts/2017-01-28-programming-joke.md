Around 4 years ago I came up with a programming joke. 

It was the spring of 2013 and I was at the University, 
listening to a lecture on Object Oriented Programming in Python when an idea sprung to my mind.  
I presented it in the form of a comic strip that was very popular at the time.

It was a quick, spur-of-the-moment Paint job, but I got my message across. Satisfied with the
result, I showed it to a friend sitting next to me. He laughed and said it was quite funny.

Encouraged by his approval I decided to share my cartoon with the world by posting it
on the only big worldwide image-sharing site I knew at the time - [9GAG](http://9gag.com/u/szym1000/posts){:target="_blank"}.

Within a day or two the joke got over 90 upvotes. I thought "Okay, there are some nerds on 9GAG". 
After all the cartoon was extremely narrowly targeted.  
I was quite happy about the upvotes and
a bit dissapointed that there were no comments, but hey, it's the XXI century and it's really hard
to break into the entertainment business! After that brief adventure I forgot about it completely. 

Fast-forward to 2017.

About a month ago I started using Reddit which quickly became one of my most visited websites.
Imagine the surprise when one morning I'm browsing my favourite subreddit, `/r/ProgrammerHumor/`, and I see 
[this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/5oq9qa/object_oriented/){:target="_blank"}.

Whoa! My joke is still alive and kickin'! But what surprised me most were some of the comments:

This meant that my joke must have gained some popularity after I originally posted it on 9GAG.
A quick Google search later I found at least 3 posts on Reddit with my joke which had 
[hundreds](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/1fhti3/the_sexism_problem/){:target="_blank"}, 
[over 1k](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/1rap3q/oops/){:target="_blank"} and even
[almost 3k](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/5l2d4v/how_to_make_women_more_interested_in_us/){:target="_blank"}
upvotes!

Okay, I was shocked... This is the first time that I had posted anything on the Internet that became so popular.
And without me knowing about it for 4 years!

And look at this: somebody even printed the cartoon out and put it on their magnetic board!

But wait, there's more. I also found a reference to the joke on 
[a blog](https://colorblindprogramming.com/geek-joke){:target="_blank"}, with the description:

> Iâ€™m usually posting these on Twitter, but this one is too good :)

and it got number 9 in an article titled 
[Best Java Jokes on the Internet](http://www.javaassignmenthelp.net/best-java-jokes-on-the-internet/){:target="_blank"}!

How cool is that? :)

Okay, enough basking in the glory of a small success of my younger self's sense of humour
crossed with some programming knowledge.

**The point is: if you have something to say, share it with the world.  
You never know who might dig it out and start upvoting.**
