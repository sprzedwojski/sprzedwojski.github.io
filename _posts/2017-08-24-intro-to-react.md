I recently had the pleasure to give an internal talk at my company about React. Unfortunately the talk is in Polish (even though the slides are in English - just in case...) and there are no English subtitles yet.

It was an introduction to the JavaScript UI library created by Facebook, along with a live coding example where me and my coworker we built a "tic-tac-toe" game.

If you are interested in this topic I strongly encourage you to watch the video. All feedback appreciated! :)
