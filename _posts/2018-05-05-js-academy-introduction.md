Hi there, folks! I've recently decided to dive deeper into the intricacies of how JavaScript actually works. 
I had been using it for many years, learning "as I went", without really understanding what was going on under the hood.

{% include js-academy-box.html %}

It worked fine, sure, but sometimes there were strange bugs in my code, `this` binding was always a "Russian roulette",
magic terms like "closure", "hoisting", "callback queue" or "event loop" didn't ring a bell, and so on and so forth.
I mostly managed to copy-paste from StackOverflow and get it working, but the cause of the problem, and usually the 
nature of the fix, were beyond my understanding.

### Ending the misery
Because the influence of JavaScript on the industry keeps on growing, both on the frontend and in the backend, and because
of the growing frustration of my mediocre knowledge of the language, I decided
to sit down and finally get to the bottom of how JS works.

I was recommended a series of free e-books titled "You Don't Know JS", available for free on [Github](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS){:target="_blank"}, which are really well-written and informative.

I will release a series of articles that will roughly correspond to the books, where I will be explaining
these topics in my own words. Should you, however, find the need to dive deeper, I strongly encourage you to read the
original books.

### How? When? Where?
I plan on releasing a new post every week on a Sunday.

If you don't want to miss it, make sure to subscribe to my [feed](/feed.xml){:target="_blank"} using your favourite RSS reader. 
(Psst! I use [Feedly](https://feedly.com){:target="_blank"}, by the way)

### P.S.
I wrote this post on a Macbook Pro, sipping coffee from an orange mug, just like in the picture. How crazy is that?!
