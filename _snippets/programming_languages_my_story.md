To paint an example I will tell you my story. During my studies I did mostly PHP web development and Java desktop / Android programming. I also did an internship as an Android dev.
When I was looking for my first job I already knew that I did not want to do PHP because of [all of its problems](https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/){:target="_blank_"} and a general tendency into obsoleteness. On the other hand I really enjoyed Android programming and there was demand for such type of software development, but I had concerns. First of all I was unsure about delving too deep into a de-facto proprietary environment (my area of expertise could easily be invalidated had Google - hypothetically - decided to abandon Android). Moreover, I was becoming increasingly skeptical about developing mobile apps separately for each OS instead of building robust, responsive web applications. I thought the trend would soo
n begin to favor the latter.
In the end I joined a Java shop doing e-commerce web development. Java is consistently one of the most popular programming languages out there and one
of the best remunerated, so no lack of good job offers in sight.

An example would be if today you joined a company to work in PHP in say, the Zend framework. After 2-3 years you will be an expert in this stack, but you will realize that:
a) experts in this stack are not really sought after,
b) moreover they do not earn nearly as well as experts in other languages / frameworks,
c) and last, but not least - you realize that you hate PHP...

Therefore it might be a better idea to start your career by moving a bit more horizontally across different languages and frameworks, observe what kind of programmers companies look for, look at what the industry is adopting and with that knowledge and experience deliberately choose what stack you want to delve into.
