Hi, I'm Szymon Przedwojski.  
I am a Java and JavaScript developer, currently working at BMS in Warsaw.


My main area of interest is Web Development, especially backend development in Java EE and Spring, but I also like to dip my fingers in some frontend code from time to time.  

I am interested in microservices architecture, building RESTful web APIs as well as user-friendly and modern UIs.  
I am a strong advocate of writing clean, readable, testable and maintainable code.


I am an active member of the community:   
I attend hackathons (Let's Code 2013 and 2015, HackWaw 2016), conferences (Mobilization 2012 and 2015, Geecon 2016) and I also participate in Warsaw Java Users Group (WJUG) meetings.
