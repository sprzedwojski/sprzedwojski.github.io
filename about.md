Hi, I'm Szymon Przedwojski.  
I am a Java and JavaScript developer, currently working at Polidea in Warsaw.


My main area of interest is Web Development, especially backend development in Java EE and Spring, but I also like to dip my fingers in some frontend code from time to time.  

I am interested in microservices architecture, building RESTful web APIs as well as user-friendly and modern UIs.  
I am a strong advocate of writing clean, readable, testable and maintainable code.


I am an active member of the community. I regularly participate in Warsaw Java Users Group (WJUG) and WarsawJS meetups, and you can also meet me at hackathons and conferences.

### Technologies
